# ((Ford GoBike System Data)

## by (Amira yousif mohamed)


## Dataset :the data set is not uploaeded with project as it was very large

> There are 174952 Trips in the dataset with 19 features ('duration_sec', 'start_time', 'end_time', 'start_station_id',
       'start_station_name', 'end_station_id', 'end_station_name', 'bike_id',
       'user_type', 'member_birth_year', 'member_gender',
       'bike_share_for_all_trip'). Most variables are numeric , but the variables bike_share_for_all_trip,user_type
are categorical and start_station_name	end_station_name user_type are objects(names).
important note i changed the duration trip from seconds to minutes
## Summary of Findings

>1- my variables of interset are (day of the week as start of a trip) and (start hour) .it was bidominal distribution for both ,thursday was the highest trip day and highest hours were  (after 5-10 am and from 17-20 in the afteroon) are the highest except for the week ends
2- the week days and start hour  are not affected by gender or subscriptions still i see an effect of age across the weekdays trips
3-i also ifound that start hour and week days  affect each other as starting hour varies according to weekdays
4-i expected that trips will be highest in week ends but it wasn't so maybe students and employees use bike sharing to arrive to thier -destination specialy that peak hours are during the day
5-the average trip takes around 11-12 minutes.
6-the trips taken in terms of time of day, day of the week are not dependant  if a user is a subscriber or customer
7- most of the trips are taken by males
8 - age ranges between 25-40
9 -most of the users don't use the share bike for all trip program ,but most of program users are from younger ages
10 -age dosn't affect user type(customer or subscriber)
11 - younger ages take longer trip duration
12-week days and duration  have a relation to be considered duration of trips gets longer during weekends sunday and saturday this can be due to pepole use bikes for sports or entertainment in the weekend
